# Decision-Tree
An implementation of the ID3 algotithm to build up a decision tree upon the popular cars data set

The car data set contains data from ~1700 cars with informations per car like 'safety' or 'luggage boot size' and a 
classification if this car should be bought or not.

This code builds a decision tree upon this data set and makes it possible to predict if one should buy a car or not. (if one has
same structured information about the desired car)

The 'program' is written in python inside a Jupyter Notebook (Decision-Tree.ipynb)
